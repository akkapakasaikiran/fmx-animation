## Declaration
We hereby declare that this assignment is our own work, and we have not copied it from anywhere. We have taken help from the
[tutorials](https://github.com/paragchaudhuri/cs475-tutorials) provided by Prof. Parag Chaudhari for a lot of the base code. 
For shading and texturing, [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/) was invaluable and we have importd some code from there as well. 
We have also referred to the official website of GLFW and GLM.

## Running the code
- `make` to compile the neccesary files and create the executable(s) 
- `./bin/a2-model-rider` to start the application for rider
- `./bin/a2-model-bike` to start the application for bike
- `./bin/a2-model-track` to start the application for track, which also renders the rider and bike
- `make clean` if you want to start afresh
