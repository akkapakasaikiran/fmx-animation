### Requirements
GLEW and GLFW. Follow [this](https://github.com/paragchaudhuri/cs475-tutorials/tree/master/Tutorial_00#before-you-begin) for installation instructions. 

### Running the code
- `make` to compile the neccesary files and create the executable(s) 
- `./fmx-animate` to start the application
- `make clean` to start afresh

### Credits
- This project was done as part of CS 475, a course at IIT Bombay. 
	[[course page](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~paragc/course/2020-cs475/)] [[showcase](https://sites.google.com/iitb.ac.in/cs475cs675-2020/home?authuser=0)]
- We made use of the [CS 475 Tutorials](https://github.com/paragchaudhuri/cs475-tutorials) for some of the base code. In particular, Tutorial 5 for Phong shading and Tutorial 7 for hierarchical modeling.
- We used the [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb/) library to read and write into files and images.
- For shading and texturing, [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) was invaluable and we have borrowed some code from there as well. 
- For the environment map we used [babylonjs](https://doc.babylonjs.com/toolsAndResources/assetLibraries/availableTextures#cubetextures).
- We also referred to the official websites of GLFW and GLM.

Song Credits (in the animated video):
- Achint Thakkar, Music Composer of the Television Series "Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story"
- Astromania, Music Composer of the Coffin Song. This was popularised by the "Dancing Pallbearers"
