## Declaration
We hereby declare that this assignment is our own work, and we have not copied it from anywhere. We have taken help from the
[tutorials](https://github.com/paragchaudhuri/cs475-tutorials) provided by Prof. Parag Chaudhari for a lot of the base code.
In particular, Tutorial 5 for Phong shading and Tutorial 7 for hierarchical modeling.
We used the [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb/) library to read and write into files and images.
For shading and texturing, [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) was invaluable and we have borrowed some code from there as well. 
For the environment map we used [babylonjs](https://doc.babylonjs.com/toolsAndResources/assetLibraries/availableTextures#cubetextures).
We have also referred to the official website of GLFW and GLM.
