## Declaration
We hereby declare that this assignment is our own work, and we have not copied it from anywhere. We have taken help from the
tutorial 7 provided by Prof. Parag Chaudhari for base code. We have also referred to the official website of GLFW and GLM.

## Running the code
- `make` to compile the neccesary files and create the executable(s) 
- `./bin/a2-model-rider` to start the application for rider
- `./bin/a2-model-bike` to start the application for bike
- `./bin/a2-model-track` to start the application for track, which also renders the rider and bike
- `make clean` if you want to start afresh
